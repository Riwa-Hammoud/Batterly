<p> Welcome to Batterly â€” an imaginary bakery filled with sweet treats, where creativity meets deliciousness! This project is a simple and cute menu website designed to showcase the mouth-watering offerings of Batterly in a visually appealing way.</p>

<h2>Why Batterly? ðŸŽ‚</h2>
<p>I love sweets and baking, so I decided to combine that passion with my coding practice. Batterly is an imaginary bakery I dreamed up to showcase my learning progress while having fun with design. Itâ€™s a reflection of my interest in creating things that bring joy and comfortâ€”whether itâ€™s a slice of cake or a well-crafted website. </p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The goal of this project was to enhance my skills with flexbox while creating a charming and user-friendly bakery menu. <i>Batterly</i> is designed to reflect my love for baking and sweets, and serves as a creative exercise in web design and layout. Through this project, I aimed to combine my passion for confectionery with practical web development skills.</p>
